Reply to individual feedback from W2: I went back to look at my annotations because I made a few... Turns out they were set to public. I copied most of them and added them to our group. 


"Many people still connect back to this early work and equate high infant and child mortality with a lack of parental investment, but subsequent scholarship has largely discredited this point of view"

This particular line connected with me because its something that I have heard many times throughout my life and even within my own family. In my family tree older generations had many kids and I have heard jokes before about caring less for an individual kid because they had many. I never really thought to question it so that line made me think of all of that.

Looking at the different gravestones at the cemetery I chose its hard to tell differences in how/who got commemorated. It looks like the larger more ornate ones are all from the same family and the rest of the stones are all similar in size and come from many families. I did see a smaller stone that belonged to the family of the larger stones and the small one belonged to their daughter who passed at 6 months old. I would assume the stone difference is due to an unexpected passing? 

Seeing the stones of children, especially the ones who passed so young buried there was emotional. There was also a couple who both died in their young thirties that was sad to see. Many of the people lived into their eighties which is pretty good I think for the 1800s. 

I would say my experience was definitely less emotional than those who went to the cemeteries physically. I see a list of gravestones and can see the families and age easily from the online view vs having to physically walk around the grounds and find those in the same families and when they died. Also the aspect of being on the grounds where people are actually buried beneath you.

I only changed a few things on mines as I thought the template fit pretty good overall. I would be interested to see if people modified it very heavily and why. I removed the dimensions of the stones on mine because it was not some feasible to capture online unless they were already listed (and they were not for my cemetery atleast). I added another picture spot to upload the back of the stone sense it looked like atleast one of my stones had some type of ingraving on a different side from the front (although its hard to tell with the pictures available). I also added a date to record the date of the picture itself because that is likely different than the recording date if your using an online image.

Overall I felt pretty good with the material this week. Only a few errors that I noted in my notes for this week. I got confused as to what the steps were asking at the end of the maps material though. It was talking about adding the points for your gravestones but I didn't really understand how that was different from the very first step where you did that in the "quick-map-with-geojson" file. (Note I uploaded those files to github wrong and they ended up in the maps folder with the other files)
