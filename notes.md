got a few errors while trying to make a new Map Warper entry. Most made sense but I had to look this one up: filename is already being used

I was confused what filename it meant because I didn't think the actual name of the uploaded file would matter but when I looked it up turns out that was it. Something about not overriding a file if they had the same name. I guess someone else had used my same file before so I had to rename it.

I had the issue with the https://localhost:8001/webmap where it was meant to just be https://localhost:8001 but thankfully I remembered seeing a bunch of discussions in the discord so I looked through them and saw the Profs post. 

I had to go back and make this repo public so I could mess around with the github pages so thats good to know in the future.
